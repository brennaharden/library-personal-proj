## Ideas and Users
# 
This app will provide libraries and their communities with better communication and access. This will help libraries secure and maintain funding by providing municipal entities with more data pertaining to the use of library resources... it will also provide a more user-friendly experience to members of the community and inform them of the many resources the library provides, helping them to engage.
Our target group is very inclusive, ranging from kids around age ten to seniors at 99+, with varying exposure to technology... for this reason, the site will need to be as accessible and user-friendly as possible.
